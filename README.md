1. Pull the **master** branch to get the last code modifications.
1. Create a branch from **master** for the task you are working on.
1. Code like a monkey! Add regular **commits** and **push** your code to the repository.
1. When the task is completed, create a new **Pull Request**.
1. Move your task to **Code Review** stack.
1. Someone else will **review** your code.
    1. If you receive a üëç  **merge** it away and **delete** the branch.
